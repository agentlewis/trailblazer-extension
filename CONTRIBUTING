This repo contains the Chrome extension for Trailblazer.

Please look through the code, open up discussions in our forum
(https://trailblazing.community/), fork the repo and make changes.

If you open a pull request with a feature, fix, or tweak; make sure you
include a description of what you've changed and why.

Once you've opened a PR, you'll need to make sure you've signed the CLA (a bot
should handle most of this), and gone through any other process before the code
can be integrated into the project.

Happy hacking!
