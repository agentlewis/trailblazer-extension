This repo contains the Chrome extension for Trailblazer.

Please check out our wiki (https://github.com/twingl/trailblazer-wash/wiki),
look through the code, open up discussions in our forum
(https://trailblazing.community/), fork the repo and make changes.

If you open a pull request (PR) with a feature, fix, or tweak; make sure you
include a description of what you've changed and why. For visual changes, a 
screenshot of them would be appreciated too.

Once you've opened a PR, a handy little bot should automatically ask you to
e-sign our CLA. With that confirmed (and a healthy measure of peer-review)
your contributions will be ready to be integrated into the project.

Happy hacking!
